## Executive Summary

`g1-deterministic-safety-runtime` is a ROS2-native safety supervision framework for the Unitree G1 humanoid robot (37 DOF). It observes robot state in real time, classifies anomalies by severity, monitors data-flow health, and reacts through a deterministic, **fully governed** recovery layer — all under a single operational authority that policy and learning layers can never override.

The project is engineered to **laboratory rigor** (MIT / NASA / Boston Dynamics style of review). Its central discipline is **operational honesty**: every claim in this repository is classified by what the evidence actually supports, and non-validated behavior is declared with the same prominence as validated results.

This README is the **master index and initial audit document**. It is intended to let an external reviewer understand the project — scope, evidence, architecture, limits — without opening every file.

**Current state at a glance:**

- Deterministic safety runtime core: implemented and tested (65 tests, CI green).
- ROS2 observability of the simulated G1 (Isaac Sim 4.5): validated.
- Severity-aware observer, health watchdog, integrated recovery, measured latency: validated (Stage 4F, P1–P6 done).
- **Unified launcher** (4G-P1): single command brings up Isaac + observer + watchdog + recovery + orchestrator in strict order, with preflight, objective signal, and robust teardown.
- **Statistical reproducibility — healthy baseline** (4G-P2-A): N=10, 100% PASS, 0 false positives.
- **Statistical reproducibility — induced fall** (4G-P2-B): N=10, 100% PASS. Deterministic fall trigger (it=450, t=54.67s).
- **Governed path TX-011** (4G-P2-C): N=13, 100% PASS. `CONDITION_DETECTED + SECONDARY + EFFECTIVE` → `STABILITY_RISK/R3`.
- **Physical latency t0→t1** (4G-P3-C): N=10, 100% PASS. Fall trigger → SafetyEvent: mean=2474ms, min=2046ms, max=3511ms.
- **Governed orchestrator→recovery path** (4G-P4-D): N=10, 100% PASS. `SafetyAction(/safety_actions)` → recovery: mean t1→t2=1.19ms. DT-4G-003 closed.
- **Operational hygiene** (4G-P5): blocking preflight guarantees clean lab (0 residual processes, 0 publishers) before every formal run.
- Continuous Integration: **CI Build green · CI Audit green** on `main`.

---

## What This Repository Is

- A **deterministic safety-runtime** for a humanoid: state machine, observer, watchdog, recovery, typed safety events.
- A **reproducible** ROS2 + Docker stack with CI that builds and tests the safety core.
- An **evidence-backed** record: every closed stage has raw logs under `runs/` and a session report under `docs/current/`.
- A **navigable audit surface**: structured docs, traceable transition matrix, per-session commit history.

## What This Repository Is Not

- **Not** a locomotion or walking controller. The G1 does not yet hold itself upright under active control (passive baseline only).
- **Not** a claim of physical control of a real G1. All current work is simulation / x86 — no Unitree SDK hardware integration.
- **Not** certified compliance with any MIT / NASA / aerospace / medical standard. The repository is *structured for rigorous audit*; it does not claim a certification.
- **Not** a VLA/policy training rig. Learning layers (GR00T, LeRobot, Gemini Robotics) are future and operate **under** safety authority, never above it.

## Validated Capabilities (with log evidence)

- **Deterministic runtime core (3C):** TransitionEvaluator (TX-001→TX-011), PriorityScheduler (4 buckets), T8Arbitrator, CompoundState. 65 tests; safety core green in CI.
- **ROS2 observability (4D):** G1 observable over real ROS2 cross-container (joints, base pose, IMU, typed foot contacts) on the T4, without the heavy RTX stack.
- **Healthy passive baseline (4E):** G1 stands passively from pose P2 + `z_cmd=0.720` + factory drives. Observer yields zero false positives.
- **Severity-aware observer (4F-P1):** INFO/WARN/CRITICAL. CRITICAL fires on `abs(q.w)<0.80` sustained over 3 fresh consecutive samples (rule 3C2b).
- **Health watchdog (4F-P2):** STALE / FREEZE / NANINF / TIMESTAMP / RATE across 5 topics.
- **Transition matrix (4F-P3):** TX-001→TX-011 traced to method + test + action, derived from source.
- **Integrated pipeline (4F-P4):** 4-component end-to-end: healthy→silence; fall→alarm; Isaac killed→STALE→recovery.
- **Latency t1→t2 direct (4F-P5):** 0.68–8.2 ms on Tesla T4 (observer→recovery direct, ROS timestamps).
- **Fault injection (4F-P6):** 5/5 PASS — frozen IMU, frozen contact, NaN joints, regressive timestamp, lost topic.
- **Unified launcher (4G-P1):** single command, preflight, objective signal wait, 4 nodes + 8 topics verified, robust teardown.
- **Reproducibility baseline sano (4G-P2-A):** N=10, 100% PASS, 0 FP.

- **Governed path TX-011 (4G-P2-C):** N=13, 100% PASS. `CONDITION_DETECTED + SECONDARY + EFFECTIVE` → `(STABLE,NONE)→(STABILITY_RISK,R3)`.
- **Physical latency t0→t1 (4G-P3-C):** N=10, 100% PASS. Fall injection → SafetyEvent: mean=2474ms, min=2046ms, max=3511ms. Includes physical dynamics, sensors, DDS transport, 3-sample rule 3C2b.
- **End-to-end governed latency t1→t2 (4G-P3-D/P4-D):** N=10, 100% PASS. SafetyAction(orchestrator) → recovery: mean=1.19ms, min=0.83ms, max=2.02ms.
- **Governed orchestrator→recovery path (4G-P4-D):** `SafetyAction` subscriber in `recovery_g1` consuming `/safety_actions`. TX-011 → `stabilization_mode` → recovery in all 10 runs. Temporal dedup guard (5s window). DT-4G-003 closed.
- **Operational hygiene (4G-P5):** blocking preflight checks 0 residual processes + 0 publishers in `/safety_events` before every run. Post-teardown hygiene logging confirms residual state after each run.

## Explicit Non-Validated Boundaries

These are stated as prominently as the validated results — this is the core discipline of the project.

- **Deadline D for recovery** — t0→t1=~2474ms and t1→t2=~1.19ms are measured, but no formal SLA or deadline has been defined. This requires calibration from 4H recovery experiments and threat model in 4I.
- **UUID end-to-end traceability** (DT-4G-002) — t1→t2 is measured but not correlated by UUID/event_id across the full pipeline. Parser infrastructure exists; formal traceability deferred to paper phase.
- **Teardown active inside container** (DT-4G-004) — `docker restart boring_noether` is required between formal runs. Teardown does not actively kill processes inside the container. Mitigated by blocking preflight; formal fix deferred.
- **Thresholds** — `FALLEN_W_CRITICAL=0.80` and `FALLEN_W_WARN=0.85` are pragmatic calibration values (DT-4F-001), not derived from a formal threat model.
- **Intelligent recovery** — recovery currently executes `stabilization_mode` uniformly for all governed events. Differentiation by `rule_id`/cause deferred to 4H.
- **Active PD control** (DT-4E-006) — the G1 does not yet stand under active control. Passive baseline only.
- **Hardware** — no Unitree SDK integration. All results are simulation (Isaac Sim 4.5.0, Tesla T4).

## Architecture Overview

The runtime is composed of five ROS2 nodes operating under a **single authority hierarchy**:

```
Isaac Sim (physics + telemetry publisher)
        │
        ▼  /g1/imu · /g1/contact/* · /joint_states
cross_consistency_observer  ──SafetyEvent──▶  safety_orchestrator_g1
        │                                              │
        │  (direct fallback)                    TX-011 SafetyAction
        │                                              │
        └──────────────────────────────────▶  recovery_g1
                                                       │
                                               /recovery_events
watchdog_g1 ──SafetyEvent──▶ safety_orchestrator_g1
```

**Authority rule:** observer detects → orchestrator governs transition → recovery acts. The orchestrator is the single point of state authority; no node can modify safety state without passing through it.

## CI Status

| Workflow | Trigger | Scope | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| **CI Build** | every push / PR to `main` | build images + test safety-core packages | ✅ green |
| **CI Audit** | weekly · tag `v*` · manual | full `rosdep install` + build + test all packages | ✅ green |

**What green means:** the safety runtime core compiles and its tests pass in a clean container. It does not validate hardware behavior, physical timing, or locomotion.

---

## Build / Test Commands

Safety-core unit tests (no hardware, no Isaac):

    docker exec boring_noether bash -c \
      "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && source /ws/install/setup.bash && \
       python3 -m pytest src/safety_orchestrator_g1/test/test_orchestrator_transitions.py -v"

Unified launcher (4G, with P5 blocking preflight):

    # Requires docker restart boring_noether before each formal run (DT-4G-004)
    docker restart boring_noether && sleep 15
    cd ~/g1-deterministic-safety-runtime && python3 sim_runtime/4G/launch_pipeline.py

Run analysis (P3/P4 metrics):

    python3 sim_runtime/4G/analyze_runs.py --phase p3b --since <YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>

Full build + test (as CI Audit):

    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    colcon build
    source install/setup.bash
    colcon test && colcon test-result --verbose

> **Note:** use `colcon build` without `--symlink-install` when `install/g1_msgs` is mounted into another container (Isaac Sim). Symlinks break cross-container imports.

## Roadmap

- **4H-P1 — Intelligent recovery:** differentiate recovery action by cause (fall vs STALE vs FREEZE vs NaN). Define `rule_id → action` mapping.
- **4I — Formalization:** recreate SAFETY_MODEL_G1.md, justify thresholds, formal assurance case (claim→evidence→limitation→mitigation).
- **4J — Paper preparation:** fault injection matrix extended (N≥10 per fault class), runtime verification properties.
- **5A — Isaac Lab:** blocked on T4 (needs GPU ≥ RTX 4080).

---

## Review Notes for External Auditors

- **Start here**, then `docs/current/` for the full thesis (v23) and latest session reports.
- **Verify claims** against `runs/4G/` (raw logs per corrida) and `docs/audit/TRANSITION_MATRIX_G1.md`.
- **Reproduce** via the CI Audit recipe above; the safety core is container-clean.
- **Scope honestly:** this is a simulation-validated safety runtime, not hardware-certified. Boundaries are explicit in "Explicit Non-Validated Boundaries".
- **Heritage:** the project migrated from an AGV pipeline; that lineage is quarantined under `legacy/`, not hidden.
